# CS220-dmfb-synthesis-skeleton
A skeleton project for implementing synthesis algorithms for digital microfluidic biochips, derived from UCR's 
open source MFSimStatic project.

## CLion (https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) is recommended, and is available for free to all students.

## Getting started (instructions provided for a CLion installation):
- Clone or fork this repo
- Open CLion and import the existing project
- Go to Run->Edit Configurations... and make sure the root of this directory is the `Working Direcotry`
- Build and run the project to ensure the skeleton is running as expected.

A basic scheduler `list_scheduler`, placer `grissom_left_edge_binder`, and router `roy_maze_router` have been included 
for reference on API usage.  Reported results (in your final submission) should compare against the given synthesis algorithms.

# CS220-dmfb-synthesis-skeleton
A skeleton project for implementing synthesis algorithms for digital microfluidic biochips, derived from UCR's open source MFSimStatic project.

## CLion (https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) is recommended, and is available for free to all students.

## Getting started (instructions provided for a CLion installation):
- Clone or fork this repo
- Open CLion and import the existing project

A basic scheduler `list_scheduler` has been included for reference on API usage.  Reported results (in your final submission) should compare against this scheduler.
